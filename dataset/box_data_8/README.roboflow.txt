The dataset includes 237 images.
Truck are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* 50% probability of vertical flip
* Randomly crop between 0 and 42 percent of the image
* Random shear of between -29째 to +29째 horizontally and -10째 to +10째 vertically
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 6.8 pixels
